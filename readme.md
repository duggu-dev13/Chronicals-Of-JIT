# 🎮 GameDev Project – My Game Development Journey

Welcome to my official repository for learning and building a game from scratch.  
This is the beginning of my journey into **game development**, where I will explore concepts like game mechanics, rendering, input handling, sound, and more.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To build an original game while learning core concepts of game design, development, and optimization.  
The game idea is currently **under development**, and this repo will evolve as planning and coding progresses.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

This repository is both a **learning log** and **development space**, tracking everything from the very first concept to the final playable build.
